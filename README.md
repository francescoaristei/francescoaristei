ðŸ’» I'm Francesco, a `Computer Science and Engineering Student` at Politecnico di Milano.
  
  I am currently working on my Master Thesis about extending Linux Kernel tool  [`osnoise`](https://docs.kernel.org/trace/osnoise-tracer.html) to work with KVM. 
 
  Before that I was a Software Engineer Intern at [`Digazu`](https://digazu.com/), where i worked on developing endpoints to call for checking data connectivity and retrieving data schema in several technologies (PostgreSQL, MicrosoftSQL Server etc).
